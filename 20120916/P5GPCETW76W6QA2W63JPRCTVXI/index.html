The following account is by a Japanese soldier who took part in the operation.<br>I came across the body of a Chinese soldier, lying face up on a footpath. An infantryman right behind me shouted, "Hey, this one's still alive." He aimed his bayonet at the Chinese soldier's heart. The Chinese soldier grabbed the blade and, summoning up his last bit of strength, refused to let go. Taken aback, the infantryman lost his spirit to stab him.<br>The Chinese soldier loosened his grip on the bayonet, and shaking his other hand pleaded in a moaning voice that his life be spared. We were in the midst of pursuing the enemy, so we could not dally, and left the scene.<br>一九四零年五月，日軍進犯宜昌，殺死中國軍民無算。參與行動的一名日軍有以下記述：<br>我看見一個中國士兵的屍體仰卧小徑上。緊隨我後面的一個步兵喊道：「啊，這個人還未死。」他用刺刀向那中國士兵心臟插去，那中國士兵一手抓住刺刀，奮起最後一點力量，不肯放手。那步兵吃了一驚，捅死他的意志也消失了。<br>那中國士兵抓住刀鋒的手鬆下來，一邊搖着另一隻手，一邊呻吟着請求饒命。我們要追趕敵人，不能多留，就轉身離去。</p></body></html>
