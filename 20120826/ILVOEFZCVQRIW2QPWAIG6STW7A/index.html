Each bragged about his exploits in the war. They laughed coarsely about the many Chinese women they had raped, and one told about seeing how far into a woman's body his arm would go, pushing his arm all the way in up to the armpit. I kept quiet. And still they went on and on.<br>"'Where was that?'<br>"'Nanking, we had the most fun in Nanking. We could do anything we wanted and steal anything we wanted.'"<br>日本投降後不久，一個日本女人在新潟市某鄉村宿舍無意中聽到幾個退伍軍人交談。以下是她的記述：<br>「我快要入睡時，五、六個男人喝起酒來，爭相誇說戰績，談到強姦過無數中國婦女，都淫穢的笑起來。其中一人說，試過把手插進女人體內，看看可插多深，結果整條手臂插了進去，直到腋下，才不能再進。我一聲不響，他們則說個不停。<br>「『是在哪裏幹的？』<br>「『南京。我們在南京最是盡興，做什麼都可以，搶什麼都可以。』」</p></body></html>
