Among the prisoners were quite a few former military police officers. One of the POWs gave the following account.<br>The storm of the Soviet Red Army's "democratisation" education gathered around us. We all feared that any opposition to it would result in a delay of our return to Japan. A work group called the "Democratisation Shock Troop" was formed, and the former military police officers joined this group. They raised their voices high chorusing "The Song of the Red Flag" and "The International" during their morning departures and evening returns to the camp. These were the men who had harshly suppressed communism and antiwar scholars and writers. I was dumbfounded at their about-face.<br>一九四七年，西伯利亞十九號拘留營約有一萬日本戰俘，其中多人曾任憲兵隊軍官。以下是一個戰俘的記述。<br>蘇聯紅軍的「民主」教育風暴席捲而來，我們為求早點返回日本，不敢稍違。拘留營成立一支勞工隊，叫「民主突擊隊」，那些憲兵軍官紛紛加入。他們早上出發、晚上回營，都齊聲高唱《紅旗頌》和《國際歌》，而這些人曾經悍然鎮壓共產主義以及反戰的學者、作家。他們這樣見風轉舵，真令我目瞪口呆。</p></body></html>
