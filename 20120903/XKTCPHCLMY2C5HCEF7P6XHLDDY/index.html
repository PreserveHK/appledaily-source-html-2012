He was tortured but refused to confess. Finally, he was used as experimental material. In a cave halfway up a mountain, medics injected air into his vein. We watched the air bubbling in as the blood vessel bulged out. He just lightly coughed and did not die. The veterinary officer cocked his head, saying that a horse dies right away from this. After about 30 minutes, they decided to stab him to death.<br>The Chinese man said something before he was stabbed to death. The interpreter told me that he said he was a good man.<br>一名前日本軍人描述他在河南信陽目睹的一個實驗：<br>有一天，一個中國人給押到我們部隊營中，懷疑是敵方的間諜，但在酷刑之下，還是不肯招供，最後給用作實驗。在一個山腰洞裏，醫生把空氣注射入他的血管。我們看着氣泡源源注入，血管脹起來，但他只是輕輕咳了幾下，沒有死去。獸醫擡起頭，說換了是匹馬，應已當場斃命。約三十分鐘之後，他們決定把他捅死。<br>那中國漢子給捅死之前，說了些話。翻譯員告訴我說，他自言是個好人。</p></body></html>
