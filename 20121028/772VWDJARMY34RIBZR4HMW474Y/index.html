He wrote :<br>I was released and told to get retrained in the military. One of my friends died in prison.<br>After entering the army, I gradually realised that I was being discriminated against. I carried out my duties adequately and fought in many battles, but I was not promoted. Moreover, my duties consisted almost entirely of extremely dangerous assignments in watchtowers with three or four other men, guarding barracks or railroads. We were occasionally attacked, and I was almost killed.<br>On the day of Japan's surrender, I cheered that I had been right. I was hit by an officer. I hit him back.<br>東京左派組織一名成員反對日本侵略中國，遭當局囚禁，後來被徵入伍。他記述說：<br>我一個朋友死在獄中，我卻獲釋，奉命到軍中接受再培訓。<br>從軍之後，我漸漸發覺遭受歧視。我執行任務毫無疏忽，也打過多場仗，但沒有獲得晉升。此外，我獲派的任務，幾乎都是最危險的，要和三、四人一起，守衞瞭望塔，保護軍營或鐵路。我們有時遇襲，我還幾乎喪命。<br>日本投降那天，我歡呼自己當年沒有看錯。一個軍官動手打我，我就還手打他。<br></p></body></html>
