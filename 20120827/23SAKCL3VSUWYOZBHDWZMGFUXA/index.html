One day, two Chinese peasant boys were captured and brought to his post. He wrote:<br>As the interpreter of the unit, I was ordered to interrogate the two brothers aged 18 and 16. It was obvious that they were not underground activists, but the commander's idea was to punish them whether they were or not.<br>Late that night, the two boys broke out of the cage that held them and ran away. The guard chased after them and captured the younger boy. Furious, the commander ordered a soldier to stab the boy to death, but holding his bayonet the soldier was unable to move. "I'll do it," said a sergeant, and jabbed the point of his bayonet into the boy's naked chest.<br>I am still unable to forget the vivid color of the boy's blood.<br>一九四五年五月，日本一個傳教士被徵召入伍，派往山海關一支警衞隊。有一天，兩個中國農民孩子被捉到他所屬的兵營。他寫道：<br>我是警衞隊翻譯員，奉命審問這兩兄弟，一個十八歲，一個十六歲。他們顯然不是地下抗日者，但無論是不是，司令官都決意懲處。<br>那天深夜，他們兩兄弟逃出困着他們的籠子，跑掉了。衞兵追趕，把弟弟捉回來。司令官怒不可遏，命令一個士兵把那孩子捅死。但那士兵拿着刺刀，無法下手。一個中士說：「我來吧。」他把刺刀捅入那孩子赤裸的胸膛。<br>我至今仍然不能忘記那孩子的血多麼鮮紅。</p></body></html>
