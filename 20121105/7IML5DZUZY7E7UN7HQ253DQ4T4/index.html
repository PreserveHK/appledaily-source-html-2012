They saw on a sandy hill on the right bank what looked like the bodies of 16 Japanese soldiers. They went ashore and one of them gave the following account.<br>The bodies were placed about a metre apart in two neat rows. Around them were scattered hats, torn coats, and cartridge cases from infantry rifles. All of them were naked, their eyes gouged out, their noses and ears sliced off, and their stomachs cut open with their entrails pulled out.<br>A short distance away were the dead bodies of a young Chinese man and woman, but they were dressed. The only wound on each was a single stab in the heart. They must have worked for the Japanese forces.<br>一九四四年杪，日本一航空支隊乘多艘小舟，沿珠江而上，開赴柳州，途中看見右邊岸上一個沙丘排列了十六具屍體，似是日本軍人。他們上岸察看，其中一人有以下記述。<br>屍體整整齊齊分為兩排，每具相距約一公尺，四周是散落的軍帽、撕破的軍衣以及步兵的來福槍子彈盒。他們全部一絲不掛，眼睛挖掉，鼻和耳朵都剜去，肚皮剖開，內臟抽出。<br>不遠處還有兩個年輕中國人的屍體，一男一女，但都身穿衣服，身上也都只有一處傷口，就是抽進心臟的一刀，他們應是為日軍工作的。</p></body></html>
