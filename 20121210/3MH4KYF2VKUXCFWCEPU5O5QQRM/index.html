I rushed over and saw that a boy had collapsed. He was 13 years old. His family had all died in the major March air raid over Tokyo. Attempting to go to relatives in the countryside, he had come as far as the town of Fukuroi in Shizuoka Prefecture. He had not eaten for days, and had no strength left to reply to questions from the people around him. All he could do was nod or shake his head, keeping his eyes closed. A woman put some food in his hand. He brought his hand towards his mouth, but he missed and the food fell to the ground. Two hours later, he no longer moved.<br>日本一個婦人談到第二次世界大戰最後一個月的一件事。<br>我房子附近那條街上，聚集了一群人。我連忙走過去，看見一個男孩子倒在地上。他十三歲，家人都死在東京三月遭受的猛烈空襲之中。他想去鄉間投靠親戚，走到了靜岡縣袋井市。由於多天沒有進食，他已經沒有力氣回答圍觀者的問題，只能點頭或搖頭示意，眼睛都張不開。一個婦人把些食物放在他手上，他把手伸往嘴邊，但位置偏了一點，食物未能落在嘴裏，卻掉到地上。兩小時後，他動都不動了。</p></body></html>
