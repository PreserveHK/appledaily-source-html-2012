He wrote the following account.<br>It was late at night that the train arrived in Shiga Prefecture. The families of the war dead were gathered at their local train stations, waiting tearfully for the moment of their meeting with the dead. A soldier wearing a mask covering his mouth gently passed the box of remains through the train window. Family members rushed to the box. Elderly parents and young wives holding children's hands or carrying babies clung to the box and wept. "This is your father."<br>Thinking, "This will be us tomorrow," we soldiers cried also and could only stand silently at the window.<br>一九三九年，一個在華的日本軍人奉命回國，把戰死者遺骸送還其家人。以下是他的記述。<br>火車到達滋賀縣時，已是深夜。各區的火車站上，都聚集了戰死者家屬，悲悲切切，等候迎接死者。一個戴着口罩的士兵，把盛遺骸的盒子輕輕從火車窗口遞出去。死者家屬跑上前迎接，抱着盒子哭泣。他們有些是年邁的父母，有些是拖着孩子或抱着嬰兒的少婦。「你父親就在這裏。」<br>我們士兵也哭起來，心想：「明天，在盒子裏的會是我們。」我們只能悄悄憑窗而立。</p></body></html>
