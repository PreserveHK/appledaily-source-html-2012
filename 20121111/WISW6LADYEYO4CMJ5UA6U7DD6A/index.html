The paymaster of a Japanese regiment gave the following account.<br>One day I was outside the town of Phu Lang Thuong procuring provisions when American fighter planes attacked. I took cover under the eaves of a house -- there was no attack on the local inhabitants' houses. I heard piano music coming from the house. The residents were a couple in their late thirties who had married when they were students at Hanoi University.<br>I thanked them for giving me shelter. They even offered me some tea. Was playing the piano even during an air raid a way to show the meaninglessness of the war? I felt as if I had been able to forget the war for an instant and regained my humanity.<br>一九四五年六月，日本在越南的陣地天天遭美國飛機轟炸。一個軍團的軍需官有以下記述。<br>有一天，我在富諒商市外採購糧食，見美國戰機來襲，就躲在一棟房子的簷下：美軍不襲擊民居。我聽見房子傳出鋼琴聲，原來裏面住了一對將近四十歲的夫婦。他們是在河內大學讀書時結婚的。<br>我獲他們庇護，向他們道謝，他們還端些茶給我喝。空襲期間彈鋼琴，是不是可以顯示這場戰爭多麼沒有意義？我一時間仿佛忘了戰爭，恢復了人性。</p></body></html>
