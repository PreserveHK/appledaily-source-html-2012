It's the Koreans' children !" Yelling out, a boy stopped playing and started throwing stones. The Korean children all ran off. One of them dropped a tin can, inside which were tadpoles. I was one of the children that chased away the Korean children.<br>In front of the Americans, however, we were pathetic children of a defeated country. "Gibu me chocolate." "Gibu me chewing gum," we begged them in our English. We knew how to discriminate according to nationality. We followed the grown-ups' example.<br>The blank page of a child's heart can be dyed in any colour. Hearing that some kindergarten children stand at attention in front of the national flag, I recall the days when we chased Korean children, stones in hand.<br>一個日本女人描述兒時的經歷：<br>「看，是朝鮮人！朝鮮人的兒童！」一個男孩叫起來，停止遊戲，拾起石頭擲去。那些朝鮮兒童都慌忙跑開，其中一人掉下一個錫罐，裏面有些蝌蚪。我也和其他孩子一起驅趕他們。<br>但在美國人跟前，我們卻是戰敗國的可憐兒童，會用古怪的英文向他們乞求：「給我巧克力。」「給我口香糖。」我們懂得按人家國籍改變態度。大人是我們的榜樣。<br>小孩子的心靈有如白紙，染什麼顏色都可以。今天，聽說有幼稚園學生在國旗之前會立正，我就想起當年拿着石頭，驅趕朝鮮兒童。</p></body></html>
