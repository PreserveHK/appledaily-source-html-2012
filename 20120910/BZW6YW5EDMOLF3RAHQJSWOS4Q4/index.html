Our forces began our movements at midnight, and engaged in fierce battle at every point. With tanks accompanied by infantry, we finally routed the enemy.<br>The tank force immediately gave chase. Ahead was a mass of foot soldiers and cavalry rushing for their lives in retreat. On the road lay many Chinese soldiers, dead or wounded. We passed over them. There was a soft impact. The tank swayed gently. It felt like being on a small boat as it ploughed through the waves. In the special circumstances of a battlefield, we could not afford to reflect on the situation with humanity.<br>一名前日本士兵描述一九四二年河南北部一場戰役：<br>這場軍事行動之中，我負責駕駛軍旅坦克部隊指揮官的坦克車。我軍半夜展開行動，處處戰鬥激烈。我們的步兵和坦克部隊一起，終於擊潰敵軍。<br>坦克部隊馬上追殺。前面一大群敗退的步兵和騎兵紛紛逃命。路上躺着很多中國士兵，或死或傷。我們開車輾過去，車下有點軟軟的感覺。坦克車輕微搖晃，有如小舟在波浪之中前進。在戰場這個特殊環境，我們不能從人道立場看當時的情況。</p></body></html>
