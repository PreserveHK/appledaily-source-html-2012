A Japanese soldier recalled what he saw on the path of retreat.<br>The road had turned into mud in the height of the rainy season. We found our way to a river crossing and camped for the night when an eerie stench of death wafted through the air. The next morning we saw that in the grass nearby were the bodies of five nurses who had taken poison and died. Written on a fragment of paper were words that looked like "Tokuyama corps". Perhaps they had intended it as a will.<br>There were also such mass suicides among sick and wounded soldiers. I came across many spots where three to five soldiers had sat in a circle and had committed suicide by setting off a hand grenade.<br>一九四四年，印度東北的日軍遭英軍擊敗。一個日本士兵憶述撤退路上所見。<br>當時正值雨潦最多的季節，路上一片泥濘。我們找到一個渡口，紮營過夜，空氣傳來一陣駭人心魄的屍臭。第二天早上，我們看見附近草地上有五個護士的屍體。她們是服毒自殺的。一張破紙上寫了幾個字，似乎是「德山醫療部隊」，也許她們把這個當做遺書。<br>傷病士兵也有集體自殺的。我路過不少地方，都見到三三五五個士兵的屍體，自殺方式是圍坐着引爆手榴彈。</p></body></html>
