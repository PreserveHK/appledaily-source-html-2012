The following account is by a Japanese soldier who fled to the mountains and wandered around the tropical forest for three months.<br>Passing through a jungle, I saw some fellow soldiers.  Some had arms or legs cut off, some had their innards sticking out of their bodies, some had had their lower jaws shattered by gunfire.  One of them crawled over to me.  Taking off his clothes, he bared his rear end and said, "Buddy, if I die, go ahead and eat this part."  I said, "Idiot, how could I eat a war buddy?"  But I could not take my eyes off the flesh on his rear.<br>No matter where I might drop dead, I did not want my mother at home to know how pathetically I had died.
