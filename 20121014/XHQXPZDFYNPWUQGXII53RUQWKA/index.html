He recorded a conversation she had with him.<br>She talked without any reserve about conditions under the Japanese military occupation. Freedom taken away, the lack of goods, the poverty of life, the brutality of military police, hatred towards Japanese soldiers. "MacArthur will certainly return and save us," she concluded.<br>"Do you hate me as well?" I glared at her. She shook her head slowly and, with tears in her eyes, said, "You're different. You're kind. You can't kill people." I felt that I had been hit over the head. I was able to comprehend her courage and her love for her country only when I saw the conduct of some of the young women in Japan after I was repatriated.<br>一九四四年，一個日本士兵在馬尼拉一家醫院留醫，幾乎愛上一位護士。他記下和那護士的一段談話。<br>她毫不隱諱，談到日軍佔領下的情況：自由給剝奪了，貨物短缺，生活困窮，軍警殘暴，當地人仇恨日軍。她的結語是：「麥克阿瑟一定會回來救我們。」<br>我瞪着她說：「你也恨我嗎？」她搖搖頭，雙目含淚，說道：「你不同，你人品好，不會殺人。」我如遭重擊。遣返日本之後，我看到一些年輕女郎的行徑，才懂得領略那護士的勇氣和愛國情懷。</p></body></html>
