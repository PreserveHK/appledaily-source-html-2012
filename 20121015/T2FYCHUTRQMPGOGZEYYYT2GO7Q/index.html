She was so shocked that she wept in her bed that night. She wrote the following account.<br>The next morning I saw the soldier, who was on kitchen duty, intently scratching his head so that his dandruff flakes would land in the soup and rice on the tray. Offering them dandruff rice seemed to be the customary way to even the score with the commanding officer and the squad leaders.<br>The night of our surrender, I witnessed many soldiers beating up several officers, who were screaming, "Forgive me, forgive me!" The scene was also so fierce that I wanted to cover my eyes.<br>第二次世界大戰期間，日本櫪木縣宇都宮市一號陸軍醫院一名護士有一晚路過兵營，看見一個士兵遭其隊長殘暴懲罰，深感恐怖，當晚躺在牀上哭泣。以下是她的記述。<br>第二天早上，我看見那個士兵。他當時負責廚務，向着托盤，聚精會神，不住搔頭，使頭皮屑一片片落在湯中飯上。給指揮官和隊長吃頭皮屑飯，似乎是士兵常用的報復手段。<br>我們投降那一晚，我目睹不少士兵毆打幾個軍官，打得他們尖叫：「饒了我吧，饒了我吧。」那場面也很殘暴，我真想掩眼不看。</p></body></html>
