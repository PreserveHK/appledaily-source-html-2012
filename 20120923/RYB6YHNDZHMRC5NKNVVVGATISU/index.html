It was impossible to climb with the wounded. Among the wounded was "M", who was close to "K". Those who pleaded, "Take us with you," were told, "We'll come back to get you." But when the company reached the summit, the commander told "K" and two other soldiers to go down and kill off the wounded. According to the commander, if the wounded were captured, they could leak information about the Japanese forces' movements.<br>"You came back for us after all," "M" wept with gratitude when he saw "K". Unable to kill him, "K" engaged "M" in a rambling conversation. But the Americans could come at any time. "K" pulled his sword out in the dark and stabbed "M" to death.<br>一九四五年，菲律賓一連日軍被美軍追逐，要攀過一座山，不可能攜帶傷兵，其中一個是M某，和K某感情特別好。有些傷兵哀求說：「不要丟下我們。」得到的回答是：「我們會回來接你們走。」但將士到了山頂之後，指揮官卻命令K某和另外兩個士兵一起下山，把傷兵殺死。他說，假如傷兵落在敵人手上，可能洩漏日軍行蹤。<br>M某見到K某，流下感激的眼淚，說道：「你們終於回來接我們了！」K某不忍下手，就跟他拉雜談起話來。但美軍隨時會出現。他在黑暗中拔出軍刀，把M某捅死。</p></body></html>
