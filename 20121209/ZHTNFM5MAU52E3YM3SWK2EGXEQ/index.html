A thunderous roar of denunciation flooded the schoolyard. Her mother was immediately called to the principal's office and cautioned severely about what should be taught at home.<br>一個日本婦人記述一九四一年她讀小學時的一件事。<br>一天早會，校長問：「假如這裏放了一面美國旗，而你正朝着這面旗走去，你會怎麼辦？」<br>大家齊聲喊道：「走過時，就踩在腳下。」當時我們處處都會看到邱吉爾、羅斯福的惡魔形漫畫。一千五百個小學生之中，只有我一個同班同學回答：「走過時，深鞠躬。」學校運動場上，響起一片如雷的責罵聲。那同學的母親馬上被召到校長室，遭嚴厲警告，叫她留意在家裏要教孩子什麼。</p></body></html>
