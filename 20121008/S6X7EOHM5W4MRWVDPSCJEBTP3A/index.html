Mr Noguchi, one of our teachers, worked together with us, and we were drawn to him.<br>Near the end of that year, he was served with his draft notice. For several years we had heard heroic words of parting spoken to us from the podium by one young teacher after another. That day we lined up as usual to await Mr Noguchi. But he could not say a single word. We heard his stifled sobs. Then he wailed aloud. He left the podium without a word.<br>Three months later, we received word that Mr Noguchi had died of illness at the front.<br>以下是一個日本退休教師的記述。<br>一九四四年，我們宮崎平野師訓學校學生被派到鄉村，協助耕種。野口先生是我們一位教師，和我們一起工作，大家都喜歡他。<br>到了年底，他接到徵募入伍通知。過去幾年，我們聽到一個又一個年輕教師站在講臺上，跟我們道別，言詞慷慨英勇。那天，我們照常排隊，等候野口先生。但他一個字都說不出來。我們聽見他忍不住的飲泣，然後他放聲大哭，一言不發走下講臺。<br>三個月之後，我們接到消息，說野口先生在前線病死了。</p></body></html>
